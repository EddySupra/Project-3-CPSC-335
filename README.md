IMPORTANT: ( we have 2 files one for each problem. The first file is in c++ while the second file is in python)

How to run our code: Method one(easy)

Go online to https://www.onlinegdb.com there you can copy and paste our code on to the text editor.
On the top right of the screen you can change what language you would like to run (This is usefull since our first file is in c++ and our second file is in python)
After you copy paste a file and choose the correct language you click on run and you will be given a terminal to input as well as view the output.

Method two: You can can use visual studios to run our code as well.

create a new file on visual studios
make sure you have both python and c++ downloaded on visual studios
then paste our code into blank file.
run it with out debugging and you should be asked for user input and the output will be displayed.
